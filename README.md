# Miniature YouTube Database Project

## Overview
This project involves the design and implementation of a miniature database system that emulates some features of YouTube. The focus is on database design principles, and the database has been normalized using the first, second, and third normal forms.

## Database Design
### Entities and Relationships
The database consists of several entities representing key aspects of a video-sharing platform, such as users, videos, comments, and likes. Relationships have been established to capture the connections between these entities.

### Normalization
The first, second, and third normalization techniques have been applied to ensure data integrity and minimize redundancy. This ensures that the database is well-structured and maintains consistency.

## SQL Code
All SQL code for creating the database and its tables is provided in the entities.sql file. This file contains the necessary statements to set up the entire database schema, including relationships and constraints.
